import { APP_ACCOUNT_PAGE } from '/snippets/variables.mdx';

## Setting up
<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You should have created an account on [Rho web app](https://rho.store).
</Info>


In the web app, go to [account settings](https://rho.store/app/account) to get an API key.

Install the Python SDK:
```bash
pip install rho-store --upgrade --no-cache
```

Import and initialize the client:
```python main.py
from rho_store import RhoClient

rho_client = RhoClient(api_key="$YOUR_API_KEY")
```

List available tables:
```python main.py
tables = rho_client.list_tables()

for table in tables:
    print(table)
```

Fetch data for a table:
```python main.py
table = tables[0]
df = table.data

print(df.head())
```

### Upload a dataset
Make sure [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is installed:
```bash
pip install pandas
```

Upload a dataframe with one line of code:
```python main.py
import pandas as pd

# example data
emissions_df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/Emissions%20Data.csv")

table = rho_client.store_df(emissions_df, name="emissions_data")
print(table.client_url)  # the URL of the table on Rho web app
```

## Summary
That's it! You have uploaded and downloaded data from `rho` using one-liners.

In the next section, we will learn how to use different types of upload and merge strategies.
